Learning git
I am learing how to use git using the github. These are my baby steps in self improvment. I am changing this file further to see how the changes are getting affected. The idea here is to verify how 2 branches can be merged. This is the readme-edits branch changes. This time i want to verify if a git push will work without explicitly mentioning the origin branchname.
