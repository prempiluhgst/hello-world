Learning git
I am learing how to use git using the github. These are my baby steps in self improvment. I am changing this file further to see how the changes are getting affected. The idea here is to verify how 2 branches can be merged. This is the readme-edits branch changes. This time i want to verify if a git push will work without explicitly mentioning the origin branchname. Verifying indexing concept with git add. Second edit after doing a git add to see what does it show up as. Again verification for git add, did commit for the previous 2 edits and this is the new edit.Testing multiple commits and push. Doing commit 1.
